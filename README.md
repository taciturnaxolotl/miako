## What's this?

This is a game I made for the [high seas jam](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C082JDEBP09)! I started wayyyyyy to late with about 5 hours and 23 minutes left in the jam. No one knows if it will be done in time but hopefully it will be fun either way. Currently I'm planning on the game being about the titular character miako who is a ninja magician who is trying to save to world by breaking into hackclub hq and stealing the source code for high seas (keep in mind this is set -1.5 months back from standard time and the source code isn't public yet). She will have to brave many obstacles and challanges but with your help she just might be able to save the day by selling the code for a massive pile of doubloons `.^-^.`

## How do I play?

Go to the github releases page [here](https://github.com/taciturnaxolotl/miako/releases/latest) and download the `miako.love` file. Then download the [love2d](https://love2d.org/) engine and run the `miako.love` file with it. If you are on windows you can also download the `miako.exe` file and simply drag the `miako.love` file onto the `miako.exe` file to run it.

If you are on nix you can also run the following commands to install love2d and run the game:

```bash
nix-shell -p love
love miako.love
```

## How do I build?

You don't need to! The game is already build and ready to play! I have a handy github action that builds the game for you and uploads it to the releases page. If you want to build the game yourself all you need to do is zip the `src` folder and rename it to `miako.love` and you are good to go!

## Really usefull things

- [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)
- [Love ASE](https://github.com/elloramir/love-ase) (for loading aseprite files)
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (for making the sprites; also i just can't say enough about how awesome this program is)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) (mood music while coding and uhh game music ðŸ«£)
- [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (for hosting the jam and being an awesome community)

## Why that License?

Well its the template license and I don't have time to change it lol.
