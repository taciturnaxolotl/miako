## What's this?

This is my personal template repo! It serves as the reference for my `README.md` formating style and hopefully soon my license scheme.

## Why that License?

Well honestly i'm not quite sure myself. I've been currently looking into [Fair Source](https://fair.io/licenses/) licenses and the PolyForm [Small Business](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/small-business/1.0.0/) license to try and build a better default licensing scheme for my projects. As of now though I typically tend to use AGPL 3.0 as my default license. My main problem with it is that it doesn't provide a clear way for businesses to use the work commercially as most companies don't seem to want their proprietary modifications open source and public (for understandable reasons). Hopefully I can have a nice clear picture of how different licenses mash together and develop a nice clean system that continues to allow others to fork and modify my projects while giving me some kick back for large scale commercial use. Yes I know that isn't technically open source but it feels like a better way of balancing openness with commercialization.
